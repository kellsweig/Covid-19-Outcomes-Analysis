# Preparing for the next Pandemic:
### An analysis of the Covid-19 Pandemic at the State and County Levels

## Problem Statement
In 2023, with the total number of new coronavirus cases decreasing and the Pandemic beginning to stabilize, Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct an in-depth analysis of the coronavirus pandemic. After more than 1 million Americans died during the pandemic, Congress tasked HHS with creating a report detailing how the response to Pandemic could have been improved as well as crafting a resiliency plan aimed at reducing death tolls of future pandemics. 

HHS received funding for this analysis and hired our consulting firm, FF consulting, to develop machine learning models that could explain which variables were most strongly linked to covid outcomes. HHS specifically was interested not only in different policy explanations, but also asked us to consider demographics such as age and race, the pre-existing health conditions of the populations, income, education, and any other factors we found to be potentially causational. 

## Background:
Before we began any data collection, we conducted research into other studies of coronovirus outcomes both national and international. With the pandemic ocurring so recently, some ofthe findings of various studies were somewhat contradictory.

- Pre-existing medical conditions
- Demographics
- Income
- Age
- Housing Crisis
- Population Size
- Population Density
- Percent employment
- Percent population insured
- Mask Policy
- Vaccination Rates
- Covid Behaviors
